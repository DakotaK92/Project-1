# Project-1

The challenge for this Project was to create a app that uses at least two APIs.

As a group, we decided to have an app that can tell a user what events are happening in a city, as well as a map to show them where they are and also display the weather. 

To do this we gave the user 6 options to choose from. They can pick Concerts, Sporting events to even Expos. After the event was choosen, the user will enter in a city they want and what radius they want from that city. At the end they can pick the date for the event. A map will activate and give all options for the event they want. And on the left will be a area that tells the tempature and a list of events.

Being over achievers we are... We used 4 APIs for our App.

We used GeoCoding, Google Maps, PredictHQ and finally OpenWeatherMap APIs.

GeoCoding and PridictHQ uses a number of varibles to store references to HTML elements and data. These include latitude and longitude for a "Distance", a location input that allows a user to input event for any city. As well as a "radius" input for for more locations.

Google Maps uses inputs from the user and displays a location using the Google Maps locator.

OpenWeatherMap uses the location and displays the weather conditions for that location on the screen.
